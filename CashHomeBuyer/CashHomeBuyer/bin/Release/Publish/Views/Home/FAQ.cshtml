    <p>
        <strong>Am I obligated to take your offer?</strong><br />
        Absolutely not. If our offer does not meet your needs, you are under no obligation to accept.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>My house needs work. Is that OK?</strong><br />
        Yes! We buy houses in all conditions. No repair is too big for us to handle.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>What types of properties do you purchase?</strong><br />
        We buy all types of properties including single family, multi-family, apartment buildings, condos, and commercial properties.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Are there any other comissions/fees?</strong><br />
        No. There are simply no additional commissions or fees. This is what makes us different from a traditional home sale.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Will you be listing my property on the MLS or buying it?</strong><br />
        Simply put, we want to purchase your house. We buy directly from homeowners for cash in as-is condition.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Will you give me a fair offer for our home?</strong><br />
        If we didn't give homeowners a fair price for their homes, no one would ever sell to us. We provide a fair market offer based on
        needed repairs, current condition, and the values of homes that are sold in your neighborhood or area.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Will I have to pay closing costs?</strong><br />
        We nearly all instances, we pay the closing costs associated with purchasing your home.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>What if I am facing foreclosure?</strong><br />
        We can help! As real estate professionals, we are very familiar with the foreclosure process. 
        Even if we don't purchase your home, we have access to resources that can help.
